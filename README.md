# Project Capsule Frontend Repository

This is the repository for the frontend part of Project Capsule, a joint effort of Wenhao "Leo" Liang and Wa Lam
"Michael" Si.

## Get Started

1. WebStorm is the recommended development environment for this project. I recommend that you get WebStorm first. It is
free for students.

2. Next, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed. Run `yarn --version` in your terminal to check. If Yarn is not
installed, go to [Installation on Yarn's official website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and follow
instructions there.

3. Clone or download this project, and open it in WebStorm.

4. Now you need to install dependencies. There may be a small window in the bottom right corner of WebStorm that asks
you to do this. If so, click "Run yarn install", and you should be good. If not, click "Terminal" at the bottom and run
`yarn install`. After it is done, there should be a folder called "node_modules" in the project.

5. To run this project locally for development purposes, click on the "Debug" button in the top right corner of
Webstorm. If it is greyed out, then you have to add a configuration first.

   1. Click "Add Configuration..." in the top right corner.
   2. Click the "Add" button in the top left corner of the window that pops up.
   3. Choose "npm".
   4. Make sure "Command" is set to "run". Then, put "dev" in "Scripts". Leave "Arguments" empty.
   5. Press "OK". The "Debug" button should now light up.
